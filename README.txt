All code is mine, I had trouble implementing the timer and used a stack overflow thread as guidance but still did not get it 
working as the specifications stated.

I also implemented a hard mode for single player where, once the player plays, the computer instantly wins.

Other than that I think I implemented everything as the specifications stated. 

Thank You.
